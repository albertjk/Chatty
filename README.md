# Chatty

## Overview and Features

This repository contains the code for the native Android Chatty app - an instant messaging app. Chatty allows a user to register and chat to other registered users. A registered user can log in to chat to others. Messages sent are shown in a chat log. If a logged in user opens the app, they can immediately see the latest messages received. 

The app screens consist of fragments and navigation is made possible using the Navigation Component. Firebase Authentication stores user credential data, Storage stores user profile images, while messages and other user data are stored in the Realtime Database.
